The acceptance tests are a set of Python scripts intended to be used
to verify an own Hermes implementation. They can be modified and
extended easily and don't need more than a Python interpreter
(version 3.8 or higher is recommended).

Conda environment for running the code is included. Before running the code for the first time, run the following command to create a new environment if you're using any Conda such as Anaconda
"conda env create -f hermes_github.yaml"
